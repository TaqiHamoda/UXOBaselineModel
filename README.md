# CIRS Baseline Model for Detection of Underwater Military Munitions (UWMM)

This project attempts to replicate the results present in `Gleason, Shihavuddin, et. al, 2015, OCEANS MTS/IEEE` using `python` frameworks. A multitude of datasets (EILAT, RSMAS, MLC 2008, EILAT 2) were used to fine-tune the models' parameters.
